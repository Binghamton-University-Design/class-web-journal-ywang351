						<h1>Typography Rddiles</h1>
						<p>In the first project, the whole class cooperated to make a typographic riddle book using movie names as answers. Here are some of my process documents.

						<h1>Riddle Me This</h1>
						<p>My selected movie is "Begin Again". During the process, I modified my work with the switching of design rules defined first by myself, then on a group scope, and finally on a class scope. For each step, I adjusted the mood of the design according to the font and color scheme formula.

						<h1>Working With the Past</h1>
						<p>Inspired by Susan Kare, our second project is about designing bitmap icons. Personally, my favorite bitmap icon designed by her is the happy Mac. I have always loved to draw faces on various objects, thus I decided to make a set of bitmap icons that can be used as emojis. Hopefully back in that era, people would like to use them for chatting online.

						<h1>Bitmap Emojis</h1>
						<p>I was originally planned to make more icons and make them as a emoji package. However I spent a lot of time on project 3 later and did not have time to do so. I also tried to color the one I liked most. It's a fun project :)

						<h1>Digital Storytelling</h1>
						<p>For the third project, I was inspired by a comic posted on Weibo (cr.@混知官方) The issue of animal protection has always been my concern. Therefore, I intend to draw some illustrations to tell a tale of a mommy bear's revenge. The ending of the tale is a bit unexpected. But followed with the stories that happened in reality, I hope this project will arouse people's attention to animal rights.

						<h1>Mommy Bear's Revenge</h1>
						<p>Through the process, I spent a lot of time making the illustrations as well as finding suitable background pictures. I also took several HTML and CSS lessons on Linda.com. Although some ideas could not be realized in my final product due to my insufficient code writing level, I am satisfied with my work.
